## Overview
This project aims to capture and act on patient feedback while providing automated reminders for appointments and medications. It supports multiple languages (French, English, Duala, Bassa, Ewondo, etc.) and is designed to function even in low-bandwidth conditions (e.g., 2G networks). The system includes a feedback analysis engine, a multilingual patient interface, and a real-time hospital performance dashboard.
